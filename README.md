# React Setup

I wanted to add ReactJS to a project I was working on so I needed to setup the webpack
config manually. This is the result of that effort after pulling out all application specific code.

This is basically `create-react-app` with less features!

## Usage

From terminal:

1. `git clone git@github.com:rbk/ReactSetup.git`
1. `cd ReactSetup`
1. `npm i`
1. `npm start`
1. Go to http://localhost:9000
